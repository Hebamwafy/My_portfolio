# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my journey and growth as a web developer. I created this portfolio to demonstrate my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **SASS** and to give visitors a glimpse into the projects I’ve worked on and the skills I’ve acquired.

## About the Project

This portfolio was a major milestone for me as it challenged me to apply what I learned in the **Advanced CSS course** on Almadrasa. It’s designed to be responsive and visually engaging, and it incorporates best practices in modern web design.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapted for all screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **SASS for Efficient Styling**: Styles are organized and modular, thanks to SASS, allowing for clean and maintainable code.
- **Animated Elements**: I used CSS animations to enhance user engagement and make the site feel more interactive.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structured content
- **CSS3** and **Advanced CSS Techniques** for styling and layout
- **SASS** for efficient and organized CSS
- **Responsive Design** principles

## Lessons Learned

This project pushed me to dive deeper into the nuances of CSS and taught me valuable lessons in designing for the web. Through building this portfolio, I enhanced my skills in:
- Writing clean, maintainable code
